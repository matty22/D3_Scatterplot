# D3 Scatterplot

The D3 scatterplot project shows the ranking of professional bicycle racers against their seconds behind the best time. The colors of each point in the scatterplot indicate whether that racer has been accused of doping.

## To Use

The user can hover over each point on the scatterplot to see information about the individual cyclist and information about their doping allegations.
